# packed-ss-template
A repository for a very basic packed secret sharing implementation this is very much "research code" and written hastily by a non-SWE person. The main purpose of this is to be used as a reference guide.

This code provided here depends on [libscapi](https://github.com/cryptobiu/libscapi) and [ntl](https://libntl.org/). You will probably need to change the CMakeLists.txt file to reflect where you have installed libscapi.
